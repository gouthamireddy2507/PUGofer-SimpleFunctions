# PUGofer-SimpleFunctions

You are required to submit two files
1. Submit the answers to the following problems in one file called yourfirstname.gs
2. Example screenshot of the gofer session where you  tried out the functions with some values. Screenshot file name should be screenshot1.gs

In the following, write a function "xyz : Type1 -> Type2" means write a function like
   xyz.a = ...something here...
where the type of 'a' is Type1 and the type of the result of "something here" is Type2 as shown below for the following sample.

## Sample exercise

**Problem:**
  Write a function "square : Int -> Int" that calculates the square of its argument
**Solution:**
    square.x = x * x

1. Write a function "capitals: String -> String" that given a 2 letter code of any state in India, returns its capital. Note: This has the same structure as our functions asciival

2. Write a function "poly1: Int -> Int" that calculates the polynomial x^3 + 4*x + 33

3. Write function "cube1: Int -> Int" that calculates the cube of its argument. Write another function "mult4 : Int -> Int" that calculates 4 times its argument. Use these functions, and "+" to write another function "poly2: Int -> Int" that calculates the same polynomial as problem 2.

4. Write a function "isPyTriple: Int->Int-Int->Bool" that given three integers a,b,c, returns whether c^2 is equal to a^2 + b^2
